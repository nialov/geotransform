# Welcome to geotransform's documentation

Geotransform is a command-line utility meant for easy transformations
between spatial filetypes (e.g. ESRI Shapefile -> Geopackage).

Can handle transformations from multilayer filetypes (e.g. Geopackage) to
singlelayer filetypes (e.g. ESRI Shapefile) by saving each layer as a single
file.

Additionally the Python functions for loading and saving data are exposed
in the library.
